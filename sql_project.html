            <h2>Data Analysis: Restaurant Orders</h2>
            <h3>Tool: SQL</h3>
        </header>
        <p>We check out all tables:</p>
        <a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="0_exp.jpg" alt="" /></a>
        <a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="1_exp.jpg" alt="" /></a>
        <p>Checking if we have nulls</p>
        <p>The table menu_items is small, so we realize it does not have nulls easily. The second table is order_details:</p>
        <a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="2_exp.jpg" alt="" /></a>
        <a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="3_exp.jpg" alt="" /></a>

        <p>Let's answer some questions:</p>
        <p>1. What were the least and most ordered items? What categories were they in?</p>
        <a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="4_exp.jpg" alt="" /></a>
        <p>The least ordered item is Chicken Tacos with 123 orders.</p>
        <a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="5_exp.jpg" alt="" /></a>
        <p>The most ordered item is Hamburger with 622 orders.</p>

        <p>2. What do the highest spend orders look like? Which items did they buy and how much did they spend?</p>
        <p>The highest spending order was for $192.15:</p>
        <a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="6_exp.jpg" alt="" /></a>
        <p>Let's check what the order was:</p>
        <a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="7_exp.jpg" alt="" /></a>

        <p>3. Were there certain times that had more or fewer orders?</p>
        <a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="8_exp.jpg" alt="" /></a>
        <p>The hour with the most orders was 12, exceeding 1600 orders.</p>
        <a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="9_exp.jpg" alt="" /></a>
        <p>The hour with the fewest orders was 10 am with just 5 orders.</p>

        <p>4. Which cuisines should we focus on developing more menu items for based on the data?</p>
        <a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="10_exp.jpg" alt="" /></a>
        <p>The best-selling category is Asian with more than 3,400 orders. However, for a better analysis, we would need to know the unit cost to evaluate in what category the company has better profits and apply a more efficient commercial strategy.</p>
        <a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="11_exp.jpg" alt="" /></a>
        <p>Let's check that the best-selling dish was Edamame with more than 620 orders. The price for this is $5. This relationship is negative; there are more sales with a dish that is less expensive.</p>
