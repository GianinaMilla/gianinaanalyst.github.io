    <p>The best-selling category is Asian with more than 3,400 orders. However, for a better analysis we would need to know the unit cost to evaluate in what
       category the company has better profits and applies a more efficient commercial strategy.</p>

    <p>Let's check that the best-seller dish was Edamame with more than 620 orders. The price for this is 5 dolars. This relation is negative, there are more
        sells with a dish is less expensive.</p>
